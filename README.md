 Smart Calculator Python project from HyperSkill

### About

Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
